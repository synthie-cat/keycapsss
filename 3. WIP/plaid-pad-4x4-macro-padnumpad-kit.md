The Plaid 4x4 macro pad is an easy DIY project designed by Ben, here at Keycapsss.com. It takes heavy inspiration from the [Plaid Keyboard Kit](https://keycapsss.com/diy-kits/90/plaid-gold-keyboard-kit-usb-c-mx/choc?c=17) making it the perfect companion to pair both up and still keep an comprehensive design on your desk.

Like the Plaid Keyboard it features only through hole soldering components but comes with support for some more modern ideas such as using an optional OLED screen, support for MX style or Choc and Choc V2 switches and up to four rotary encoders. 

## Product features:
* Designed by Keycapsss.com
* Easily build with only through hole components
* Support for MX (3 and 5 pin) as well as Choc and Choc V2 switches 
* Customizable Open Source Firmware (Supported: QMK, VIA, VIAL)
* Optional OLED and rotary encoder support
* Two designs: Black/Gold/Brass or White/Silver available

**Note**: The OLED screen is fully optional and not included in the kit. The rotary encoders are fully optional and not incluided in the kit. They can either be positioned in the top row or the right column.

## Kit Includes:
* Top, mid and bottom PCBs
* All required solder parts
* Acrylic guard plate, spacer and screws
* Pre-Flashed ATMEGA328P MCU with ready-to-use VIAL firmware

You need:
* 16x switches (3 or 5 pin)
* Keycaps
* USB-C cable
* T6 Torx screwdriver (White variant) / Slotted screwdriver (black variant)
* Soldering iron

**Important**: The USB-C can be difficult to solder properly without using flux. If you want me to do it for you add the [USB-C Soldering Service](https://keycapsss.com/new/123/solder-service-for-usb-c-connector?c=18) 

You optionally need:
* OLED Display ([SSD1306 0.91''](https://keycapsss.com/keyboard-parts/parts/80/0.91-oled-lcd-display-128x32-ssd1306-i2c?number=KC10048_WH))
