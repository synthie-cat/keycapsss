With most modern kits its hard to say what it takes to get a beautiful, working mechanical keyboard. But the Plaid - designed by [Takuya Urakawa](https://twitter.com/hsgw) - is a feature complete ortholinear 40% mechanical keyboard that has nothing to hide.

Unlike the original Plaid Kit the Plaid Gold Kit offers additional switch options as well as an updated USB-C connection while maintaining the accessibility of the build. It features only easy-to-solder through hole components but is still fully equiped with everything you need to use it on a daily basis. If you need an additional macropad the Plaid pad will be the perfect companion. 

## Product features:
* Through-hole components
* 4x12 ortholinear layout
* MX Style (3 or 5 pin) or Choc switches
* QMK and VIA compatible Microcontroller Unit (ATMEGA328P)
* USB-C connectivity 


## Kit Includes:
* Main PCB + Bottom
* All required solder components
* Transparent acrylic guard plate
* Brass spacers and screws

*Note:* 
* For transport the acryl guard plate has a bluish protection film applied, which should be removed before assembly.
* The USB-C can be difficult to solder properly without using flux. If you want me to do it for you add the [USB-C Soldering Service](https://keycapsss.com/new/123/solder-service-for-usb-c-connector?c=18) 


You need:
* 48x MX or Choc switches

* Soldering Iron
