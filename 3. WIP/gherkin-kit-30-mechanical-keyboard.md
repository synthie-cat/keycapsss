The Gherkin is what happens when you want to explore what a minimum viable keyboard needs. 30 keys, only through hole soldering components, a micro controller and: There you go! The Gherking was envisioned by [di0ib](https://github.com/di0ib) from the [40percent.club](https://www.40percent.club/) and kindly made available under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license - so you can build you own!

The kit comes with everything you need to build the "no space wasted" Gherkin: A PCB based housing with a bottom- and key plate, all required solder parts including the MCU, spacers and screws as well as rubber feets. Just add switches and caps of your liking and you are good to go Gherkin around!

## Product features:
* Through-hole components
* 3x10 ortholinear layout
* MX Style (3 or 5 pin)
* QMK and VIA compatible Microcontroller Unit (Pro Micro)

*Note*: Original firmware was written for [TMK](https://git.40percent.club/di0ib/tmk_keyboard/src/branch/master/keyboard/gherkin/actionmap_gherkin.c) but it's advisable to use QMK instead. Since there are basically no mod keys you should also look into [tapping](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_tap_dance).
