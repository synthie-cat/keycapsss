The Discipad - designed by [Coseyfannitutti](https://www.cftkb.com/) -  is a very beginner friendly project that allows to create a useful and feature complete mechanical keypad.
The PCB features an eye-catching exposed array of components on the top, supports up to 17 individual keys and comes with VIA-Firmware preflashed on the microcontroller unit (MCU).

## Product features:
* USB-C connector
* Easy to solder through-hole parts
* ATMEGA328P MCU
* Gold plated pcb
* Customizable Open Source Firmware (Supported: QMK, VIA, VIAL)

The MCU comes preflashed with VIA firmware which allows for full configuration without needing to programm.

## Kit Includes:
* Mid and bottom pcb (black/gold)
* Top plate to support 3Pin switches
* 3mm clear acrylic guard plate
* Solder parts
* Spacer and screws 
* Pre-flashed Atmega328P (Bootloader & VIA Firmware)
* Self adhesive rubber feet

*Note:* For transport the acryl guard plate has a bluish protection film applied, which should be removed before assembly.

You need:
* 17x switches (3 or 5 pin)
* Keycaps
* USB-C cable
* T6 Torx screwdriver
* Soldering equipment

**Important**: The USB-C can be difficult to solder properly without using flux. If you want me to do it for you add the [USB-C Soldering Service](https://keycapsss.com/new/123/solder-service-for-usb-c-connector?c=18) 

You optionally need:
* [3x 2u stabilizers](https://keycapsss.com/keyboard-parts/parts/7/transparent-pcb-mount-stabilizers-2u/6.25u)
* [Dampening foam](https://keycapsss.com/keyboard-parts/dampening-foam/127/discipad-dampening-foam)
